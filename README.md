# Review Tracker for Obsidian 
> ***Currently in Development*** 
>
> *Currently broken :(*

Review tracker automatically tracks when to review your notes based on the frequency of reviews and the time since last review. 

It extracts headers from you notes and generates two to review. Notes are unique based on their link, so header names can collide across notes without issue.

#### Settings
- `Require Tag`
	- If enabled, only files with a given tag will be included in tracking. Off by default.
- `Tags`
	- A list of accepted tags, if *require tag* is enabled.
- `Smallest Header Level`
	- The lowest level of heading including in the tracker. If lvl *2*, then only the heading *h1* & *h2* will be included.
